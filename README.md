# ENGG-1340-project
With the development of the economy, people's salaries are becoming higher and higher. However, many people do not know how to manage their finances well so that they fritter most money away and have few savings. Therefore, learning how to manage and allocate our money properly is of paramount importance to our daily life and can help us create more wealth. In this project, we are going to implement an accounting system to help people keep track of their daily expenses and incomes and help them form a good habit of managing money.
The following are some features about this account system.
1. People can add records of incomes, and expenses at any time.
2. The records contain some basic information, such as the amount of money, date of record, type of income or expense (e.g., food, game, salary,etc.), type of account (e.g., cash, bank card, credit card, etc.).
3. The records can be deleted and edited at any time.
4. Users can view their records by date, type, and account.
5. The system can provide a statistical report of the user's financial state (e.g., monthly incomes and expenses, the percentage of food expenses, etc.).
6. The system allows a budget setting. When expenses reach the budget, there will be a warning from the system to remind users.
7. The system will support multiple currencies by categorizing different currencies into different groups when people add records and allow users to change one currency to another when it is necessary.
